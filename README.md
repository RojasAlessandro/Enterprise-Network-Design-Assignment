# Enterprise_Network_Design_Assignment
A simulated enterprise network for SIT across buildings E2 &amp; E6 using VLSM, VLANs, DHCP, ACLs, EtherChannel, and Router-on-a-Stick. Designed for security, scalability, and redundancy in Cisco Packet Tracer.

A simulated enterprise network infrastructure design for SIT, spanning two buildings (E2 & E6), implementing VLSM subnetting, VLAN segmentation, and secure, scalable routing using Cisco Packet Tracer.
Key features include:

Subnetting via VLSM for optimized IP allocation

Inter-VLAN routing using Router-on-a-Stick

DHCP configuration with separate pools per VLAN

ACLs for printer access restriction

EtherChannel for link aggregation and redundancy

WPA2-secured wireless APs in lab zones

Full network topology across 6 VLANs and 2 routers

Designed by Group 6 for INF1006 Computer Networks.
